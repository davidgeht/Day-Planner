# Day-Planner
This application is designed to help the user schedule his work day accordingly.
The top of the page contains current date, as you scroll down it has time blocks from 9am-5pm.
There is a text box that allows the user to write in their tasks for the hour and save it to local storage.
The app is also designed to follow with current hour, so that the user is notified when the time block as expired and the new hour begins with color coded text boxes.
The grey text box indicated the hour has past, the red indicates the present hour, and the green indicates the future hour. 
Screen shot of the time blocks can be viewed here:
